    "data_intro": "The primary reason for creating this dataset is the requirement of a good clean dataset of books. Being a bookie myself (see what I did there?) I had searched for datasets on books in kaggle itself - and I found out that while most of the datasets had a good amount of books listed, there were either a) major columns missing or b) grossly unclean data. I mean, you can't determine how good a book is just from a few text reviews, come on! What I needed were numbers, solid integers and floats that say how many people liked the book or hated it, how much did they like it, and stuff like that. Even the [good dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k#books.csv) that I found was well-cleaned, it had a number of interlinked files, which increased the hassle. This prompted me to use the Goodreads API to get a well-cleaned dataset, with the promising features only ( minus the redundant ones ), and the result is the dataset you're at now.",
