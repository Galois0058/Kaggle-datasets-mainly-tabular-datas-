### A new and Bigger dataset.

Hello everyone,   
I am an absolute fan of MTBI, and using it to find personality traits. Traits used to understand myself and others better, in a more generalizable manner. Being able to predict personality through social media posts is certainly intriguing concept. This dataset has certainly sparked the interest of a lot people regarding the same, and thank you (dataset creator) for that.  
However, I think it's time that we have a better, and bigger version of the dataset that helps us train more holistic models. Things like, a more balanced dataset, or alt text instead of hyperlinks which provide no information, and other data cleaning processes that a social media post contains. I am planning to start working on this, and posting here to find people who are willing to work together with me to do so. I'll soon attach the public repository for the same. Moreover, please tell me your ideas as to how we could collect such data.  
Thank you ðŸ˜„ ,  
Divy.

The main /mbti subrredits also have users that are tagged with their type and scrapping their posts would be interesting. I also found another dataset here which is pretty big. I am unable to load it as I do not have access to the necessary tools but you can take a look here.

Thank you a lot. Honestly, the data you sent me is a much better version of this one. However, it still has quite a lot of problems like the content in it seems to be not just the posts but comments too, however it's hard to find which post it's referring too. I.e. the context is completely lost. And it also just makes a simple assumption of which group the data belongs to based on its location of post (subreddit name) which is generally not true. Most active users engage in atleast 1 more group than their own subtype. I do think it's a very good starting point though!

I think Reddit would be a great pace to scrape for data. There are many subreddits specfic to Individual MBTI types. One interesting task would be to cluster data from each MBTI type to try detecting sub-types.

I think this gets really tricky when actually implementing, because most posts in MBTI subreddit are not complete text. And more often than not the media attached (video, image, gif) often contains most of the semantic content of the post.

I think what we can do is have HR use MBTI, and ask them to give review of the quality of the person in relation to their work/job. I absolutely believe that there's an MBTI for each job positions.

Hi Divy,I read your comment about the new dataset. If you've collected it, would you consider sharing it with me? I'm in search of a suitable dataset for my project. Thanks!

Is the data you collected independent and identically distributed? That is, is each example in the dataset coming from a different person? Or do the same people recurr along the dataset? This is quite important to build any significant model and it could be the next big improvment for this dataset.

I would totally love to work with you as I am working on a somewhat similar problem that may give us more insight to the human behavior. hit me up and we can discuss

Yep, totally agree with you on the larger dataset !! Please let us know if you do indeed come across such a dataset.  
We have also used this dataset, and our work was accepted into *IEEE International Conference of Data Mining 2020*. The code is available if anyone was interested: [https://github.com/yashsmehta/personality-prediction](url)
