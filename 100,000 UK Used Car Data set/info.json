        "model": "Picked two fairly common cars on the British market for analysis (Ford Focus and Mercedes C Class). The hope is to find info such as: when is the ideal time to sell certain cars (i.e. at what age and mileage are there significant drops in resale value). Also can make comparisons between the two, and make a classifier for a ford or Mercedes car. Can easily add more makes and models, so comment for any request e.g. if you want a big data set of all Mercedes makes and models.",
